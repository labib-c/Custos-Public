## About Conor

I am an undergraduate Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Toronto. I have a lot of experience in Machine Learning and leadership roles. In my free time, I like doing just about anything. I love the outdoors, playing basketball, just chilling outside, or going to cool bars and restaurants, but I also love to just sit inside and watch Netflix or read. If it's a cool experience, I am open to trying it. Some of my favorite experiences have occured while traveling and trying new things.

## Weaknesses

- My work ethic is too cyclical
	- I have periods of intense focus and sometimes of laziness.
- I can sometimes be withdrawn or very energetic.
- I never lie.
- I play too many video games, just kidding there's no such thing as too many video games.
- I have no weaknesses.
