Diversity

Diversity is one of the key foundations to a successful startup. The importance of diversity cannot be overstated when considering the idea that as a business, the range of customers you advertise and sell your product will not belong in a "one size fits all" net. Having the expertise in multiple fields, employing a culture built around promoting diversity, and accepting employees regardless of their differences results in negating oversights that would've previously been made due to a lack of diversity. This document will explain the diversity exhibited in our team at Custos and how this will benefit our venture.

Labib's experience in developing web apps through personal projects and coursework will prove to be useful when creating a product that is handled by the end user. 

## Diversity

Our team has a varied background, but we acknowledge that we do not have people experienced in/who are UX/UI Design.

### How this can impact us

This makes it difficult to create an application in which the main focus relies on explainability and interpretability. Having someone with experience in developing applications based around what features user's focus on would be extremely beneficial to create a user-friendly, customer centric interface.
