Diversity
---

Diversity is one of the key foundations to a successful startup. The importance of diversity cannot be overstated when considering the idea that as a business, the range of customers you advertise and sell your product will not belong in a "one size fits all" net. Having the expertise in multiple fields, employing a culture built around promoting diversity, and accepting employees regardless of their differences results in negating oversights that would've previously been made due to a lack of diversity. This document will explain the diversity exhibited in our team at Custos and how this will benefit our venture.


Team Background
---

Our team has a varied background in educational disciplines, industry experience and ethnic backgrounds.
Labib was born in Bangladesh but has lived in Toronto for 17 years. His education as a Computer Science Specialist and industry experience in companies such as Amazon and RBC has provided him with valuable insight on the operations of a large company, developing complex and dynamic projects, and the characteristics of a strong team.

Hillary was born and raised in Ontario, Canada - her parents immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong when they were only teenagers. Hillary grew up doing a variety of extracurriculars including swimming, dance, cheerleading, piano, singing, badminton, and provincial-level gymnastics. She graduated from Biomedical Engineering at the University of Waterloo and she completed six different software development and data sciene internships. Some of her more unique experiences include working at Ultimate Software in Silicon Valley as a data scientist and Vector Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Toronto as a machine learning researcher.

Devin Singh has a diverse background both culturally and throughout his career. He was born in Ontario to immigrant parents who traveled to Canada from Guyana in South America. Being raised in the Greater Toronto Area, mixed with his own background has exposed Devin to a variety of cultural perspectives. In addition, he is married to a wife who was born in South Korea and has a large blended family with people from many cultures and sexual orientations – it truly is a “Modern Family”.
His working experience is rather diverse as follows: managing camps at the YMCA, selling jeans at the Gap, working for the Ontario Ministry of Finance & Revenue as a business analyst, launching a successful corporate media production company, working as a paediatrican and emergency physician at SickKids hospital, to now founder and CEO of an AI based tech start-up company within it’s first year. Out of all this experience Devin states, “I have never learnt more about the art of persuasion and communication as I did when selling jeans at the Gap. The lessons learned have rippled throughout my entire professional career and are skills I still lean on to this day as an Emergency doctor.”
This breadth of exposure in life allows Devin to see past the obvious and the skill set required to engage with clients to drill deeper into understanding what the true problems are at hand are and how best to solve them with technology and workflow optimization.

Conor was born at McMaster University Hospital and raised in New Jersey. He lived there for 18 years then went off to University in Toronto. His family now resides in Florida. He studies Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Toronto. He has work experience at a startup called Bibbit and ML experience from internships at Raymond James Financial and Google. He has also worked in ML as a researcher at the Vector Institute for two years. Conor's interests are very diverse including being the lead in his highschool musical.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

Our team has....

### Subject Matter Experts
Everyone at Custos plays a role as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in many differing fields.
Labib's expertise lies in full-stack web development. Although the product will rely on complex Machine Learning models, the customer will need to interact with this in a simple, aesthetically pleasing way. Labib's experience in developing web apps through personal projects and coursework will prove to be useful when creating a product that is handled by the end user. Hillary is a subject matter expert in data science, machine learning, and biomedical engineering. She provides valuable insight into how our team can use data, statistics, and machine learning to build an explainable, insider-threat detection system to prevent data loss and ultimately, save our customer's money.
Our team does not directly have deep subject matter expertise in the financial sector cyber security space. As a result we have identified external subject matter experts who are providing consultation and mentorship throughout our development process: Brian Lynch - TD bank and a past fraud detection specialist and manager, Pouria Mashouri – Master of computer science and experience full-stack developer, machine learning programmer, and system administrator with experience in cybersecurity.

## Diversity

Our team has a varied background, but we acknowledge that we do not have people experienced in/who are UX/UI Design.

### How this can impact us

This makes it difficult to create an application in which the main focus relies on explainability and interpretability. Having someone with experience in developing applications based around what features user's focus on would be extremely beneficial to create a user-friendly, customer centric interface. [Can we change this its kind of trash]

People with backgrounds that differ from out own can help us in the THEME industry because...
