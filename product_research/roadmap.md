# Roadmap

This describes our plans to develop our product which will aid large companies within the BFSI industry in detecting and explaining anomalous behaviour to prevent internal threats and data loss.

## Short Term

**Duration:** Q4 2020

We intend to develop and deploy a minimal viable product by the end of Q4. This product will be hosted on a web application and be able to predict anomalous behaviour and provide explanations.

Our plan to succeed will be with the following objectives:
Week			Objective (Backend; Frontend)
11/1/20			Train Unsupervised Learning Model for threat detection; Create components for main dashboard
11/8/20			Implement and code Explainability; Create components for anomaly finding page
11/15			Develop backend connections with Firebase and Frontend; Modify components to use data received from backend
11/22			Connect backend to ML model and Database; Create users
11/29			Make final edits and submit

## Medium Term

**Duration:** Q1 2021

Month			Objective
January			Perform user-research on MVP (specifically from RBC and CI Financial)
February		Meet with Darktrace to discuss possibly partnering so we can use explainability for their products
March			Refine algorithms based on these meetings and requests (specifically extend ML models to more datasets)
April			Continue this iterative process to work towards a final version

## Long Term

**Duration:** 2021

Year			Objective
2021			Depending on talks with Darktrace, either finish product to license to other cybersecurity firms or develop product with RBC
2022			Finalize product for initial release to customers. License product to BFSI Industry customers. Continue market outreach and campaign.
2023			Round out customer base and ensure product is stable for current customers. Make any changes as required. Continue expanding to new customers.
2024/2025		Revisit partnerships and look for more opportunities for international expansion
2026-Future		Continue expansion and developing a product that keeps customers safe in an explainable and understandable way. Stay true to basic mottos as we expand internationally. Ensure products are state of the art.
