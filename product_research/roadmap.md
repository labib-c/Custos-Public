# Roadmap

This describes our plans to develop our product which will aid large companies within the BFSI industry in detecting and explaining anomalous behaviour to prevent internal threats and data loss.

## Short Term

**Duration:** Q4 2020

We intend to develop and deploy a minimal viable product by the end of Q4. This product will be hosted on a web application and be able to predict anomalous behaviour and provide explanations.

## Medium Term

**Duration:** Q1 2021

We intend to improve the MVP based on customer feedback (specifically RBC) as well as conducting user research on additional potential customers. As far as machine learning, we intend to update algorithms to increase performance and explainability. Furthermore, we intend to fine tune models so they function on additional customer datasets.

## Long Term

**Duration:** 2021

We intend to develop a product for the BFSI Industry to aid in cybersecurity efforts to prevent internal threats. The focus of our product will be on predicting possible internal threats as well as providing explanations for these predictions.
