# Roadmap

This describes our plans to develop our product which will aid large companies within the BFSI industry in detecting and explaining anomalous behaviour to prevent internal threats and data loss.

- Setup a roadmap for at least the duration of this course. You may go longer to indicate long term goals. The roadmap can include as much detail as you want with the following conditions:
    - Must include your immediate next steps
    - Must include plans to perform user research
    - Must include low-fidelity plans for a launch date
    - You fill in the gaps. Be careful not to go too detailed as we have limited knowledge still.

## Short Term

**Duration:** Q4 2020

We intend to develop and deploy a minimal viable product by the end of Q4. This product will be hosted on a web application and be able to predict anomalous behaviour and provide explanations.

## Medium Term

**Duration:** Q1 2021

We intend to... medium-level of detail plans.

We plan to launch a barebones alpha version in the medium term.

## Long Term

**Duration:** 2021

We intend to develop a product for the BFSI Industry to aid in cybersecurity efforts to prevent internal threats. The focus of our product will be on predicting possible internal threats as well as providing explanations for these predictions.
