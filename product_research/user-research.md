# User Research

We performed user research to assess the intuitiveness and breadth of features regarding our product. As one of Custos' main features is to improve the user experience of analysts, we want to assure the main interface is as easy to use as possible.

We interviewed two people who would potentially be using the product, using the first iteration of our prototype (found below).

The three tasks we asked each of the users to perform are the following:
1. Identify and navigate to anomalous finding description page
2. Identify most contributing factor for why this event is an anomaly
3. Filter Events table to only display potential anomalies
