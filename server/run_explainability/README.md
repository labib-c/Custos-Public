This folder contains python files used to generate Custos Scores.

Specifically, explainability.py contains a class that can be used to generate Custos Scores. If you wish to generate Custos Scores on the anomalous data, simply run the file after having generated background.csv and anomalous_data.csv.
Reference the notes found in the following [README](../upload_results/README.md) for how to generate background.csv and anomalous_data.csv properly.
